                    Nowadays, the traces of humans are
                    left all over the social media. Massive
                    volunteered geographic information
                    (VGI) contributed by social media users
                    offers great opportunities to create
                    new methods of understanding human
                    activities. The generation and analysis
                    of the digital footprints on social
                    media have the potential to uncover the
                    underlying spatial-temporal patterns
                    of how people interact with the outer
                    environment differently.<br>
                    This study provides an approach to
                    differentiate the urban traces left by
                    tourists from diverse origin countries
                    and local citizens as different user
                    groups based on the VGI obtained from
                    a social media platform Flickr. The study area is Vienna, Austria.
                    Kernel density estimation was used to analyze
                    the distribution of Flickr photos.

            <h3>Research Design</h3>
            <p>
                This study is designed as five main stages (shown as Figure 1), which includes original data review,
                data
                pre-processing, data analysis, result visualization and result conclusion. The data pre-processing is
                divided into two parts, which are the processing of Flickr Data and the processing of thematic POIs. In
                order to achieve the three sub-objectives mentioned above, the data analysis phase is also separated
                into
                three parts including obtaining the footprints of different user groups, modeling the city center and
                creating a tourist profile. As for the visualization, a density map is used to represent the footprints
                of
                tourists from different origin countries and also local citizens; A wind rose is used as a
                representation of
                tourist profile which depicts the thematic interests of each user groups; A heat map is used to
                illustrate
                the temporal trend of the footprints among different user groups. The detailed study approach will be
                explained in the later section.

            <h3>Overview of Approach</h3>
            <p>
                In order to solve the research questions, the study approach (see Figure 2) is designed to obtain the
                footprints by applying Kernel Density Estimation on the classified Flickr data in order to represent the
                urban traces of different user groups.<br>
                With a threshold filtering, the areas of interest (AOIs) of each user group can be extracted. Comparing
                with
                the extracted AOIs with thematic POIs, the characteristics of each user group can be concluded into a
                tourist profile. In the meanwhile, the seasonal trend of each groups’ urban traces can be revealed by
                the
                footprints obtained from temporal-wise classified Flickr data as a temporal aspect of the tourist
                profile.
                And city center as one type of AOI can be modeled from semantically filtered Flickr data.

                    citizens? Which are those differences?</b><br><br>
                As it will be shown in the following footprints results, distinctive footprints are generated for each
                user
                group. Among all the obtained tourists’ footprints, a similar overall pattern is shared: Despite the
                different density value
                distribution, it is noticeable that pictures are always concentrated in the southwest part of Innere
                Stadt,
                Schönbrunn, Belvedere, and the northwest corner of Prater (see Figure 3a). Especially, the area around
                Stephansdom is overlapped with the area where more than 90% pictures are located in all footprints;
                areas
                around Imperial Palace and Heldenplatz (Heros’ Square) are always overlapped with the area of more than
                40%
                picture density in all footprints as well (including locals’ footprints).</p>

            <p>As for the footprints of local citizens (see Figure 3b), they are more dispersed than other footprints.
                More
                areas with a relatively higher density of pictures are revealed. The boundary of areas with more than
                20%
                picture density is expanded to the district Liesing as well as the district Kagran. For example, regions
                around Kaisermühlen and Simmering are both one of the newly revealed hotspots. Also, for local citizens,
                pictures are more concentrated in the southwest part of the district Innere Stadt. The area of picture
                density greater than 40% is larger, compared with the area with the same picture density in the
                footprints
                of other user groups.</p>

            <p>
                Regarding the footprints of domestic tourists (Figure 9c), it also shares certain similarities with the
                locals’ footprints apart from the footprints of other tourist groups. Hotspots in the district Kagran,
                Kaisermühlen can be also noticed. Same with the locals’ footprint, there is a higher concentration of
                pictures at Schönbrunn zoo while you can barely see it in footprints of other tourist user groups. But
                for
                the area at the northwest corner of Prater, either the footprints of domestic users nor local citizens
                show
                a higher density of pictures comparing with other user groups.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                For the footprints of other tourist groups, the patterns are generally similar. It is worth noticing
                that
                pictures are denser (greater than 20% of density) in the area of Belvedere in the footprints of tourists
                from Germany, the UK as well as Italy than the groups of US and Austria (in the interval of 10% -20%
                picture
                density). In addition, it shows a higher concentration of pictures at the northwest corner of Prater in
                the
                footprints of tourists from Germany and the UK. On the contrary, the footprint of tourists from the US
                shows
                a relatively lower concentration of pictures (Figure 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g ).

                <b>Research Question 2a: How differently do tourists and local citizens perceive the city
                    center?</b><br><br>
                As the density map depicts (Figure 4), tourists and local citizens do have a rough agreement on the
                location
                of the
                fuzzy concept – city center. They both consider that area around Stephansdom is the city center and all
                the
                nuclei locations are located in the district Innere Stadt. But as we can see from the result, local
                citizens
                obviously have a clearer idea of the range of the city center. The area with a higher density of city
                center
                related pictures is more compacted. Conversely, tourists seem to be more ambiguous about it. All three
                nuclei locations share almost the same density of city center-related pictures.

            <p><b>Research Question 2b: Is there a relation between the footprints and perceived city center among
                tourists
                and local citizens? Is this relation clearer among certain user groups?</b><br>
                <br>
                The answer is positive.<br>
                The area of Stephansdom, where both groups believe the city center is, shows a picture density greater
                than
                90% in the footprints of both groups. However, the relation is clearer among the tourist user group. The
                perceived city center of tourists coincides with the area of higher picture densities in their
                footprint.
                It can be inferred that the main area of tourist’s urban traces is restricted to where they consider
                being
                the city center. But locals have a wider range of visiting the city, so in their footprints, the area of
                higher picture density is extended.

                A wind rose is used to visually represent the distinctive thematic interests of each user group during
                the
                whole period of time. Figure 6 provides a general overview of all different user groups which includes
                the
                group of local citizens, all tourists, domestic tourists, tourists from Germany, UK, US, and Italy. The
                axis
                represents the ratio of targeted POIs in each category, the higher the ratio is, the more interested the
                corresponding user group is to this certain category.

                As we can see, none of the user groups show much interest in shopping areas as well as contemporary
                sights
                and architecture. However, there is still 20% of the shopping areas and contemporary sights are targeted
                by
                local citizens. The user group of locals has a leading position in each dimension followed by domestic
                tourists. And both groups have around 80% targeted POIs for religious sights as well as operas and
                theaters.
                But locals show a particular interest in museums comparing with other groups. 86% of museums are
                targeted by
                locals while only 57% are targeted by tourists from German and domestic tourists. As for the four other
                user
                groups, tourists from Germany has higher interests among historical sights and architectures, museums,
                nature and parks; Tourists from Germany and UK are both more attracted to operas and theaters compared
                with
                other international tourists; Tourists from Italy also has greater interest in religious and
                architectures;
                Moreover, tourists from the US shows relatively higher interest in dining and drinking places. The
                orange
                line shows the overall thematic interests of all tourists, which shows that tourists are generally more
                interested in museums and less interested in places for shopping, dining and drinking as well as
                contemporary sights and architectures.</p>

                <b>Research Question 3b:Are there relations between the targeted thematic POIs in the diverse footprints
                    and specific origin countries? Temporal trend: Is there a seasonal trend among them?
                </b><br><br>
                The seasonal changes of each user group’s footprints can be revealed by the heat map below (Figure 7).
                The
                feature value which represented the attractiveness of each POIs are represented as colors. The
                darker the color is, the more attractive a POI is considered. However, it is hard to conclude a general
                trend shared by all user groups. But some minor patterns can be noticed.

                As we can see from the subplot for the user group of all tourists, there is not much change over seasons
                for
                all POIs. However, Wiener Staatsoper (Vienna State Opera), Albertina and Heldenplatz (Heroes’ Square)
                are
                attracting more pictures in spring and autumn. While for locals, people tend to be more into parks and
                museums in autumn than any other season. For domestic tourists, POIs regarding the category “Nature &
                Parks”
                are less popular in summer and winter. In addition, for tourists from the US, they seem to be more
                interested in historical sights and architectures (Heldenplatz and Spanish riding school for example) in
                spring and autumn. And the most popular POI -- Stephansdom (St. Stephan’s Cathedral), the feature value
                barely changes among all user groups in all the seasons.

                First, as it has been widely discussed, the quality of VGI is not assured. The contributors of these
                data
                are mostly general public instead of experts or scientists. For the geotagged Flickr data, there are
                possibilities of false location tagging. The accuracy of the location tag is effected by the localness
                of
                the Flickr users. Apart from that, even if the users are well aware of the environment, there are still
                chances for them to commit errors. Because The motivation of the contributors is also relevant. When
                people
                uploading pictures on social media platforms like Flickr, what they focus on is the image instead of the
                precise location of taking pictures.<br><br>

                Second, More specifically, the representativeness of VGI is limited due to the uncertainties in the
                demographics of social media users. Some groups are under-represented. For example, people with less
                digital
                literacy or with really senior age and young age are less included in the social media dataset.
                Additionally, since the data is only acquired from Flickr, only Flickr users are studied in this
                research.
                Not every tourists is active with social media while travelling, not to mention only Flickr.<br><br>

                Another issue that might introduce bias is the classification of locals and tourists. For users who have
                ambiguous origin information, the localness is determined by the classification based on the temporal
                feature of their Flickr uploads. It is related with their uploading behavior. But it does not 100
                percent
                reveals users’ actual activities in Vienna.<br><br>

                Furthermore, whether and how a POI will be photographed is dependent on the type of the place and the
                type
                of activities people conduct at this spot as well. Like the shopping area mentioned above, people don’t
                take
                pictures while they are shopping. Some types of POIs will be underestimated due to the lack of uploaded
                pictures. But it does not necessarily mean that in reality, people do not visit those places as much as
                others. Also, it is sometimes not possible to get access to the Internet at some places. So people
                cannot
                upload the
                related pictures in time. The delay in uploading might lead to a higher chance of false geotagging.
                While for some POIs, the location of the uploaded pictures is mostly not exactly where the POI is
                located.
                POIs like museums, architectures, operas and theaters are always photographed from the outside of it. So
                the
                concentrated spot of related pictures is dislocated.
